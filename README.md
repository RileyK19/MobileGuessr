- ios app, so run through xcode
- I wanted to write an ios app because I have some experience in ios and 
  I found that that would fit the challenge better then a website. The 
  person who needs a game on the train would find it more convenient
  than a website. I also made a quick 10-15 minute geoguessr-like
  game for him to play. The backend is in the swift file called 'File'
  and the frontend is in the 'ContentView'.
